# NYtimesAPI
This Python project allows users to search and view New York Times articles from any given date in history, displaying top articles based on relevance. The app pulls article data from the New York Times API and sorts it based on word count and section priority. Articles can be viewed, exported to CSV, and analyzed with a pie chart visualizing article distribution across different sections. The application features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI, a database to store past searches, and an easy-to-deploy macOS .dmg file for installation.
